# POSSUMS
This repository contains MATLAB scripts to (1) conduct the porewater sampling routine ("PWSamplingRoutine.m") and (2) analyze the flow injection data (four scripts in "Analysis" subfolder; the workflow for these scripts is described in "FICalibrationAnalysis.docx").  It also contains the POSSUMS user manual ("POSSUMS_Manual.m").
